## Preconditions

### Google account

There is a Google account for the parent representatives. The login user name
is the email address of the parent representatives and the password shall be
the same as for the Microsoft (email) account given by the leadership of the

### Input Excel file stored on Google Drive

Home Kita days are to be named by parents and need to be stored in an Excel
file on Google Drive at <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/my-drive>.

The Excel file is named `HomeKitaTage.xlsx` and must be located at top level
in the Google Drive.

The first sheet in the Excel file must come with the following columns:

- `Name`
- `Group`
- `Monday\nmorning`
- `Monday\nafternoon`
- `Tuesday\nmorning`
- `Tuesday\nafternoon`
- `Wednesday\nmorning`
- `Wednesday\nafternoon`
- `Thursday\nmorning`
- `Thursday\nafternoon`
- `Friday\nmorning`
- `Friday\nafternoon`
- `Comments`

Above, the characters `\n` are to be understood as a newline character.

The column `Name` contains the name of the child, `Group` the group to which
the child belongs to in the kindergarten. The entries in the day columns shall
be empty or filled with a number `1` meaning that the child is absent (at home)
at this day and time. The digit `1` has been chosen to be able to sum up the
number of children that are absent at a given day and time to see, if the
absence times are equally distributed.
